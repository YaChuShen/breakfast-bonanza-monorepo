| 2 | 1,400 | 1243.92ms | +203.14% |
| 3 | 2,300 | 358.37ms | +100.85% |

## Performance Insights

**Connection Performance**: Good
- Average connection latency of 244.38ms demonstrates good real-time performance

**System Reliability**: Excellent
- 100.00% connection success rate under heavy load

**Scalability**:
- System successfully handled 3,000 concurrent connections
- Redis adapter enables horizontal scaling for future growth

## Architecture Migration Impact

### Before: Render.com (Single Instance)
- ❌ Limited to single instance
- ❌ No horizontal scaling capability
- ❌ Shared infrastructure limitations
- ❌ Auto-sleep on free tier

### After: AWS EC2 + Redis
- ✅ Peak capacity: 3,000 concurrent connections
- ✅ Horizontal scaling via Redis adapter
- ✅ Dedicated compute resources
- ✅ 100% uptime capability
- ✅ Sub-1158ms P95 latency

## Technical Achievements

1. **Infrastructure Migration**
   - Migrated from Render.com to AWS EC2
   - Implemented Redis adapter for state management
   - Enabled horizontal scalability

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Designed comprehensive load testing suite
   - Automated baseline and stress testing
   - Established performance benchmarks

3. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Real-time health check endpoints
   - Connection metrics tracking
   - Performance degradation detection

## Recommendations

2. **Latency Optimization**: P99 latency is 2151.00ms. Investigate tail latencies.
4. **Production Monitoring**: Implement CloudWatch/Prometheus metrics for production monitoring.
5. **Auto-scaling**: Configure auto-scaling policies based on connection count and CPU utilization.
